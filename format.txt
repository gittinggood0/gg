this is a reference as to how I chose to format diffrent things on this repository

ALL IMG SRC ARE ="../../img/<IMAGENAME>"

template.html is a template (duh) for lesson pages
?-Q.html is a template (again, duh) for quiz pages

pages are named based on their seciton in the book
X-Y_<sectionTitleFromTableOfContents>.HTML where X = chapter number and Y = section number

All pages use style.css

Each page has a main div where all content is to be placed. other divs are header, footer, etc.
