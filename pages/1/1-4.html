        <h2> Lesson 1-4 </h2>
       <p>As I mentioned in 1-3, your hosting server is something to consider when using Git. Servers, just like your local machine, need
           the latest version of the repository. If you don't update them, it will result in a merge conflict, something that I will discuss in chapter 3. 
           <Br><BR>
            In web development, people (including myself) use GitHub to store their website files, and download them from github (via a git pull) for use on their server. 
            This allows you to be able to make changes to it from anywhere on your local machine, commit/push it to the cloud, and then pull it onto your server.
            Web development teams use this technique to create elaborate websites that have many data-driven functions, and style it as well. Where one person might
            code the back-end (like the JavaScript, PHP, etc), another team member will be in charge of doing styling (CSS) on the site. Using GitHub to collaborate on these Things
            will make it easier for you to divide and conquer the task at hand, and by downloading (pulling) from GitHub after someone commits/pushes from their local machine,
            GitHub can be used as a great way to track and develope your website.
