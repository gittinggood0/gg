        <h3> What is GitHub/Git? </h3>
        <p> As I mentioned previously, GitHub is considered to be "Version Control" Software. Git is the language, if you will, of the entire system.
            Git checks when a file is modified in the slightest of ways. From adding a bunch of lines of code, to just adding a space, Git is constantly
            reading files and trying to figure out if you made any changes. This allows for better tracking of changes in a project, and I mentioned previously,
            you can revert to a previous version of a file if this go sour.<Br><Br>
            
            When using GitHub, you are interacting with multiple interfaces. I will go into more detail about them in section 1-4, but the three you work with are:
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Your Local Machine </li>
                <li>GitHub's Server in GitHub HQ </li>
                <li>[If you're putting code on a company server], a server </li>
            </ol>

            GitHub is used by many, from small companies to large corporations, to better control their application developement as well as have a central spcae for 
            developement to take place and be tracked. In the coming sections and chapters, I will teach you the different things you can do with GitHub, but for now let's move on to some Things
            that you will need before we "git" started! (See what I did there? Yeah I know my humor is whack.)
