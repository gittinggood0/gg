        <h3> Cloning a Repository</h3>
        <p> The word "clone" simply means to make a duplicate of an already existing thing. Clones come in many different shapes and sizes, and in our case today, cloning means that we are copying the repository in question from GitHub.com onto our local machine. <BR><BR> <a href="../../pages/1/1-3.html"> Remember the GitHub Triange from 1-3?</a> The idea behind that triangle was to show you the different parts of where your repository will be stored. We are now looking at the bottom-left of that triangle, your local machine. The device that you will code on. The good news is that just like making a repository, it is very easy to clone onto your machine. I will demonstrate 2 ways to do so, via GitHub Desktop [which is simply a cake walk] or for a little more of a challenge [something that you would have to do on a server, like in the bottom-right part of our triangle], on terminal.</p>
