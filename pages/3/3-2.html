        <p>So our first step is <span class="code">git pull</span>. Pulling is basically what you did when you cloned the repository. This step is the least common one you will do of the big 3, however, it is important in preventing merge conflicts, which I will explain in a later chapter.<br><BR>
        The process of doing a <span class="code">git pull</span> is when either your local machine or the server your working on needs to get the most up-to-date versions of all of the files in the repository. As illustrated in the graphic above, the idea is that you are loading up your slingshot, or in our case, our local/server side folder with the new versions of a file.
    <BR><BR>
    I personally suggest that you frequently do a <span class="code">git pull</span> so that you don't have outdated files. At a minimum, do one <strong> BEFORE</strong> you start working! Again, I'll explain my reasoning more later. Let me show you how to do a <span class="code">git pull</span> on both GitHub Desktop and Terminal.</p>
