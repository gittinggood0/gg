        <h3> Git Pull - What is it/How to do it</h3>
        <img src="../../img/3-2_gitpull.png" alt="slingshot with git pull written below">
        <p>So our first step is <span class="code">git pull</span>. Pulling is basically what you did when you cloned
            the repository. This step is the least common one you will do of the big 3, however, it is important in
            preventing merge conflicts, which I will explain in a later chapter.<br><BR>
            The process of doing a <span class="code">git pull</span> is when either your local machine or the server
            your working on needs to get the most up-to-date versions of all of the files in the repository. As
            illustrated in the graphic above, the idea is that you are loading up your slingshot, or in our case, our
            local/server side folder with the new versions of a file.
            <BR><BR>
            I personally suggest that you frequently do a <span class="code">git pull</span> so that you don't have
            outdated files. At a minimum, do one <strong> BEFORE</strong> you start working! Again, I'll explain my
            reasoning more later. Let me show you how to do a <span class="code">git pull</span> on both GitHub Desktop
            and Terminal.
        </p>
        <h4>GitHub Desktop</h4>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Open up GitHub Desktop.</li>
            <li>Click the "fetch origin" button at the top right corner. (see Figure 3A)</li>

            <img id="img2" src="../../img/3-2_git_pull.png" alt="Git Pull menu"
                style="width:100%;max-width:500px;margin-top: 50px;">
            <small style="margin-bottom: 50px;">Figure 3A: This is what the window should look like after a Git Pull,
                and sometimes, you need to manually check for a newer version of the repository, and that will also make
                the window appear this way.</small>
            <li>If there a newer version on Github.com, it will show something similar to Figure 3B. If it doesn't show
                anything different than Figure 3A, then you're good to go!</li>
            <li>Click "Git Pull" in either part of the window. (see Figure 3B)</li>
            <img id="img2" src="../../img/3-2_clickbutton.png" alt="new Repository"
                style="width:100%;max-width:500px;margin-top: 50px;">
            <small style="margin-bottom: 50px;">Figure 3B: The button to click is circled for your convenience. You can
                click either one labeled "git pull".</small>
            <li>Once it is done pulling, it will look like Figure 3A.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Terminal</h4>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Open terminal and navigate to your repository via the <span class="code">cd</span> command.</li>
            <li>You can check the status of the repo by typing <span class="code">git status</span>. If it looks like
                figure 3C, you need to do a pull. If it looks like Figure 3D, you are good to go!</li>
            <img id="img2" src="../../img/3-2_needPull.png" alt="need a pull"
                style="width:100%;max-width:500px;margin-top: 50px;">
            <small style="margin-bottom: 50px;">Figure 3C: You'll see something like this if there's a newer version of
                the repository available.</small>
            <img id="img2" src="../../img/3-2_gitStatusGood.png" alt="don't need a pull"
                style="width:100%;max-width:500px;margin-top: 50px;">
            <small style="margin-bottom: 50px;">Figure 3D: You should see this if there isn't a newer version
                available.</small>
            <li>To do the actual pull, type in <span class="code">git pull</span> and click enter. (see Figure 3E)</li>
            <img id="img2" src="../../img/3-2_gitPulling.png" alt="don't need a pull"
                style="width:100%;max-width:500px;margin-top: 50px;">
            <small style="margin-bottom: 50px;">Figure 3E: Just simply type <span class="code">git pull</span> to do the
                deed of pulling from github.com.</small>
            <li>Once you did that, it should look like Figure 3F. It will tell you what files it added/removed and how
                many lines were modified.</li>
            <img id="img2" src="../../img/3-2_pulled.png" alt="don't need a pull"
                style="width:100%;max-width:500px;margin-top: 50px;">
            <small style="margin-bottom: 50px;">Figure 3F: It will show some different pieces of metadata and other
                jibber jabber that even I don't know the meaning of, but it is working properly.</small>
            <li>To be sure everything worked, you can type <span class="code">git status</span> again. It should like
                figure 3D.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>That is all that there is to pulling. You'll notice that these commands all start with <span class="code">git</span> because they run in the Git language. In the next section, we will explorer how to do commits, and why they are important.</p>
