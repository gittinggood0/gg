        <h2> Lesson 3-1 </h2>
        <h3> The big three commands </h3>
        <p>GitHub, in nature, is a fairy simple tool to use. I like to chalk it up to being like a DropBox/GoogleDrive
            etc of coding. It is much better off being used compared to these cloud providers because of its usefulness
            in tracking stages in the development process. <Br><br> As a routine, you will only use 3 commands very
            frequently. There are many many more commands that you can and will reference when things don't go to plan,
            but for our purposes today and for the day-to-day, these are the big three commands to learn and become an
            expert on:</p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Git Pull</li>
            <li>Git Commit</li>
            <li>Git Push</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These 3 commands are the quintissential commands. You will use them very frequently, and they all play a key role in making your repository worth-while. I will preface this chapter too by saying that GitHub isn't as easy as traditonal cloud storage, but the added steps in the uploading process makes it easier to track the different versions of your project. In the next seciton, I will talk about the first one, <span class="code">Git Pull</span>.</p>
