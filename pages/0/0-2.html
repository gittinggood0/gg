        <p id="subtitle"> A more simplifed way to understand GitHub.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="main">
        <p> There are many reasons why someone going in the field of programming should understand GitHub. Here are my top 3:</p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Version Control is a industry standard practice.</li>
            <p class="subtext"> Most big companies use some sort of Version Control. GitHub, which is owned by Microsoft is the most common. It is crucial for one to at least get the base idea down, so that if they work in a company that does use Git or another Version Control software, they understand the basic workings of the software.</p>
            <li>It is a great way to track changes in the development process.</li>
            <p class="subtext"> The whole process of coding is an iterable operation. You start with a blank html page, and end with a whole system. Along the way you are going to make changes that could either make it work or break ths system. The beauty about GitHub is that each time you upload your code, you get a commit ID. You can use that ID to revert to an old version of your code in case it breaks, or to benchmark it against a new version.</p>
            <li>GitHub is a great way to collaborate with other developers and supervisors on a project.</li>
            <p class="subtext"> In working with GitHub, you can see who changed what about a file at any given moment. Moreover, paired with VS Code, there are helpful extensions that show version history in more detail as a project progresses. A team can use GitHub to code in one central place and view these changes together, unlike in a Google Drive folder where you cannot see version history of a code file.</p>
        </ol>
        <p>So, in conclusion, GitHub and Version Control are powerful. Using GitHub properly can result in a better overall project, as well as more control over the entire process of making the system. You can find previous commits and revert to that version if things go awry. Teams can work in it on the same files and see changes together. So now that I have sold GitHub (a free product), let's learn about GitHub and talk about some of the stuff I discussed here.</p>
