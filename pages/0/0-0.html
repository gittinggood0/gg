        <h3> About this text </h3>
        <p>So, I don't want to call this a textbook, because it is not a textbook. I personally didn't enjoy reading textbooks in college, so this book is worded very informally, and it is not meant to be a 100% end all be all GitHub guide. With that being said, I am going to try to add as much stuff about Git as possible. Hopefully this text will help you better understand Git and GitHub.<BR><BR>You will notice that there are bits of <span class="code">code</span>. These is meant to help you navigate Terminal/puTTY. I strongly suggest that you do not copy/paste the code, as that doesn't teach you anything. Also, you'll spend more time copying/pasting versus typing. When you hover over the code, it will turn yellow.<BR><BR>Each chapter will have anywhere between 2 and 5 sections. Some will be lengthy, some will be short. At the end of each chapter, I recap all the vocabulary that I mentioned in the chapter. I also add have a quiz which pulls directly from the text, that is not covered in the review.This is done so that you take the time to read the book and understand the text.<BR><BR>
        This text is open for anyone to use at anytime. The author encourages you to share, reproduce, and distribute this text. However, any mention of GitHub is a copyright of GitHub.<Br><BR>
        Finally, I just want to say that I really do hope that this text helps you out. Git and GitHub can be very daunting in the beginning, and hopefully this text will simplify the concept. If you find errors or want to suggest a topic, please email me using the email in the footer of each page!<BR><BR><span class="warning">Also I noticed that in some of my images, my spelling was off. When I get a chance, I will correct this, but these spelling errors will have 0 effect on the instructions/actions that you will follow in this text.</span>
