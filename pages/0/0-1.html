        <h3> Who am I? </h3>
        <p> Hello. My name is Faiq Ashraf. (My first name being pronounced like "Mike" but with a F). I am a senior at
            Indiana University in Bloomington, IN studying Informatics and Business.
            In my freetime, I like to make websites like this where I can help others understand things that might be
            confusing/complex. However, I also like doing other normal person things like playing vidoe games, hanging
            out with friends, and cooking.
            <BR><BR>
            Like I said, I am studying Informatics which basically is using technology to solve everyday problems. I
            have always found ways for technology to solve my problems growing up, and knew that I wanted to work in a
            tech related field. My goal is to be a product manager at a midsized company one day.
            In order to get to that point, it is important to reinforce things that I learned in undergrad, like GitHub
            and version control software. I first started using GitHub when I was a Sophomore at IU, in my C200
            programming class (yes, I was a CS major before, no I didn't like it one bit). I continued using it for a
            long time in my undergrad and found that not many people we're using it in Informatics.
            <BR><BR>
