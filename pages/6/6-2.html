        <h3> Terminal </h3>
        <p>This is the program you should be familiar with by now, it's the black and grey window that you can use to navigate directories and compile files. I don't think there is more to say about it, given that it is the scope of this website more or less. <BR><BR>I will include a section about terminal commands at the end of this text for you to reference. They will help a lot for when you navigate the world of terminal and unlock many uses that you may not have thought of using terminal for. First up, let's learn how to open up a connection to a server in terminal.
        </p>
        <h4>Opening a connection in terminal</h4>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Locate terminal on your Macintosh. It is already installed on your machine.</li>
            <li>Type in the command <span class="code">ssh username@domain.com</span> and click return.</li>
                <p><span class="iu">IU students: For you, it will be your IU username @silo.luddy.indiana.edu</span></p>
            <li>Type in your password and click return.</li>
                <p><span class="iu">IU students: For you, it will be your IU passphrase. You will have to complete duo authentication before proceeding to step 3.</span></p>
            <li>You should see some sort of welcome message, as well as on the bottom left, a line that says <span class="code">[yourUsername@theServer ~]$</span>.This area is where you will input commands.</li>
            <li>For security reasons, it is crucial that you log out from a remote connection when you are done working. To close a connection, simply type in <span class="code">logout</span> or just close the terminal window.</li>
        </ol>
