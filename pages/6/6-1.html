        <h3> CyberDuck </h3>
        <p>
            <span class="warning" style="display: block;">WINDOWS USERS: This stuff is not going to work on your machines. This chapter is meant for Mac users only. Please see chapter 7 for windows's equivalent tools.</span><BR><BR>
            Now in order to do some of the things that we do, we need tools. You need a screw to put together two pieces of wood, and a screwdriver to put in the screw. Working with Git is no different, and so I will show you some tools that you will find useful in your coding endeavour. <Br><BR>Cyberduck is a program that allows you to manage files on a remote server (i.e. your school/company's server). Think of it like a server-side finder window. You can drag/drop files from finder into a Cyberduck window and upload it to your server account. 
            <BR><BR>Now I am aware that using this tool specifically can make you wonder "Why should I use Git Pull, or GitHub at all if I can just drag-n-drop files from my machine onto the server? Well you inquisitive soul, the reason is because of Version History! (this word ring a bell?) When you drag-n-drop directly onto a server, Git doesn't know that you did that until you commit/push your changes. This can also lead to merge conflicts, if for example, you and a peer are working on the same project and concurrently making commits. <BR><Br><span class="warning">So my suggestion is to only use CyberDuck when necessary, and do the labor intensive <span class="code">git pull/commit/push</span> for the sake of your files and version history.
            </span>
            <BR><BR>Now that I got all that jazz out of the way, let me show you how to use Cyberduck.<BR><BR>
            <h4>First time setup</h4>
            <ol type="1">
                <li><a href="https://cyberduck.io/>">Download CyberDuck.</a></li>
                <li>Open CyberDuck and click "Open Connection".(see Figure 6A)</li>
                <img id="img2" src="../../img/6-1_openCon.png" alt="open connection in cyberduck" style="width:100%;max-width:500px;margin-top: 50px;">
                <small style="margin-bottom: 50px;">Figure 6A: Look at the top-right of the photo. That is what you want to click.</small>
                <li>Fill out the open connection form with your correct information. <span class="iu">(IU students, use the following info:)</span></li>
                <ol type="A">
                    
                    <li><span class="iu">SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)</span></li>
                    <li><span class="iu">Server: silo.luddy.indiana.edu</span></li>
                    <li><span class="iu">Username: your IU username</span></li>
                    <li><span class="iu">Password: your IU passphrase</span></li>
                    
                </ol>
                <li>Once you have logged in, you should see a window that looks similar to this. (see Figure 6B)</li>
                <img id="img2" src="../../img/6-1_files.png" alt="file directory viewer in cyberduck" style="width:100%;max-width:500px;margin-top: 50px;">
                <small style="margin-bottom: 50px;">Figure 6B: Yours might be blank at first, or contain very few files.</small>
            </ol>
            <h4>How do I get in after I set it up for the first time?</h4>
            <p>To reconnect next time, just click the clock icon in the top toolbar, and then find the connection you made before, and then you're back in!<BR><BR>Next we shall take a look at Terminal, a tool that on its own is very powerful.</p>
