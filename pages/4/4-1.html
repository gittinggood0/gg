        <h3> What is Branching? </h3>
        <p>So I have a confession to make - I am not the best at branching. To be 100% honest, as of the time of writing, I have only once done any type of branching. It was for a C & UNIX class I took in Undergrad. With that being said, I am not opposed to learning about it, just like how you aren't opposed to learning about Git and GitHub (well hopefully you aren't). So let's talk about Branching, shall we?<BR></br>
        Branching is simply creating a partition in your project for you to be able to separate finished and unfinished parts of a project. I personally equate it to a factory-store relationship. When you buy something, like toilet paper, it has to be made (tree cut down, extract paper fibers from the tree, package it, etc). Once that is done, it is transported to the store so that you, the consumer, can buy it. In that process, someone is making toilet paper from start to finish on one "branch" of this metaphor. On the other branch, another entity, like Target, is another branch who is selling and displaying the finished 16 pack of tollet paper rolls. <BR><BR> On the next page, I will discuss why it is important to branch.
