        <h3> What are Merge Conflicts? </h3>
        <p>When you hear the words "merge conflict", what do you think of? To me, I think of that awkward situation when I am trying to get into the left lane a mere few feet before a light because I have to make the turn there. The stress of having to indicate and look out, not to mention blind spots drives me (see what I did there?) crazy when I have to merge. Luckily for you, Merge Conflicts in Git aren't as complicated.<BR><BR>A merge conflict is simply when the upstream (aka github.com) version of your repository is different from that of what you have on either your local machine, server side, or even both.Git sees two different versions of a file and needs your help determining what changes to keep and what to get rid of, and thus describes a merge conflict.<BR><BR>In the next section, I will talk about how we end up with a merge conflict.</p>
