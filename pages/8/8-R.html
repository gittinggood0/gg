        <h2> Chapter 8 Review </h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;"> For this chapter, I would suggest making flash cards for each of the commands and view them that way. I will make a Quizlet set of the commands soon. For quizzes/exams, I will pull directly from the text to create questions that test whether you read the text or not! Any/all commands mentioned in this chapter (including from the embedded Google Document list) are fair game for the quiz! You may or may not use some of them, but it is important to know them because you can find use for them later on. Click the 'next page' button when you're ready for the quiz.
