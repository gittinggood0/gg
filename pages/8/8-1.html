        <h3> Commands in Terminal </h3>
        <p> <span class="warning">I mentioned this before, but just to be clear, these commands will also work in puTTY.</span><BR><BR>
        Anyways, Terminal as you know is our way of interacting with Git and a server at the same time. We use it to connect to a server, do stuff to files (create, edit, save, and compile), and we also can use it to help us navigate the harddrive (on Macs only, puTTY doesn't do it on PC, that I know of.) <BR><BR>A command is a word that is entered in the bottom of the terminal window after the $ sign. It looks something like this: <BR><span class="code">$insertCommandHere</span><BR><BR>Commands come in all different shapes and sizes. Some require 0 input (like <span class="code">ls</span>) and some might require 1 or more inputs (like <span class="code">cd Desktop/</span>). By default, when you enter terminal, you are placed in your hard drives root directory. This usually looks like <span class="code">YourComputerName:~ CurrentLoggedInUser$</span>.<BR><BR>
        Here are some things to keep in mind when using Terminal:
        <ol type="1">
            <li>To go up a directory, type in <span class="code">cd ../</span></li>
            <li>When typing a <span class="code">cd/</span> command, you can sort or autofill by pressing the TAB button to have Terminal fill in the rest of your directories name. This also works with files.</li>
            <li>Aliases are shorthand commands to run tasks. They can make your life a lot easier. For example, when I was an undergrad at Indiana University, I used an alias called <span class="code">i495/</span> to run the ssh command to log into terminal. I did similar ones to access mySQL databases as well. These can save you a lot of typing, <a href="https://jonsuh.com/blog/bash-command-line-shortcuts/" target="_blank">and I learned how to do it here. (follow the instructions labeled under "Permanent Aliases".</a></li>
            <li>Be aware of what version of terminal that you are running. There are many, and some commands are supported on a select few versions.</li>
            <li>All commands are case sensitive, as are file and directory names. Case and point, Terminal interactions are case sensitive.</li>
        </ol>
        <BR><BR>In the next section I will point out the most useful/frequently used commands in Terminal.
