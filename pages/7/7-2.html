        <h2> Lesson 7-2 </h2>
        <h3> puTTY </h3>
        <p>The equivalent to Terminal in the Windows world is Command Line, or commonly denoted as CLI. The problem with it is that it does not have a command to interact with a UNIX server, like Terminal. That is where our good friend puTTY comes in to action.<BR><BR>
        puTTY is a software that is similar in interaction as Terminal and is used to interact with a server. From what I know, you cannot use it on your local machine, but I could be wrong. It too, like Terminal, uses commands to do stuff. This was the way of interacting with a computer in the olden days (the 1980s and earlier, more specifically), but this technique can be useful for a few different things. First, let's figure out how to connect to a server using puTTY.</p>
        <h4>First Time Setup/Logging In</h4>   
        <ol type="1">
            <li><a href="https://www.putty.org/" target="_blank">Download and install puTTY.</a></li>
            <li>Upon startup, you will see a bunch of text fields to log in with. The only field to modify here is hostname. Do so by entering your host domain here.<BR><span class="iu">IU Students: silo.luddy.indiana.edu</span></li>
                <img id="img2" src="../../img/7-2_loginPuTTY.png" alt="new Repository" style="width:100%;max-width:800px;margin-top: 50px;">
                <small style="margin-bottom: 50px;">Figure 7B: This is what the login screen looks like. DO NOT modify any other fields unless specified by an instructor or iT.</small>
            <li>Click Open and then you should be prompted in 2 separate prompts to login. Enter your Username and Password as needed. <BR><span class="iu">IU students, after entering login information, you will have to do Duo Authentication before being able to work on Silo.</span></li>
            <li>That is it. If you have done it all correctly, you should see a screen similar to Figure 7C.</li>
            <img id="img2" src="../../img/7-2_welcome.png" alt="new Repository" style="width:100%;max-width:800px;margin-top: 50px;">
            <small style="margin-bottom: 50px;">Figure 7C: Every server should have some sort of welcome message. This is the one that IU uses on Silo.</small>
        </ol>
        <p>To get back in at any time, repeat the aforementioned steps. Like I said in Chapter 6, 8-3 will have a bunch of useful commands in a cheatsheet for you to reference. <a href="../8/8-3.html" target="_blank">You can view 8-3 here.</a> Now let's recap what we've learned on the next page.</p>
